5. **Update Documentation**: Add device to supported hardware list

### Protocol Analysis Process
1. Follow the [Wireshark Capture Guide](docs/wireshark-windows.md)
2. Use the [Capture Log Template](docs/templates/capture-log-template.md)
3. Document findings in `docs/protocols/`
4. Include hex dumps and command structures
5. Test against multiple firmware versions
