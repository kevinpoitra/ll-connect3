# <img src="resources/logo.png" width="50" align="center"/> LL-Connect 3 — SL-Infinity Hub

Complete Linux support for the Lian Li SL‑Infinity hub: a kernel fan driver and a Qt desktop app that mirrors Windows L‑Connect 3. The installer has been tested and verified on Kubutu 24.04LTS

## Quick Install (Recommended)

Use the provided scripts to install everything (libraries + driver + app) automatically.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joeytroy/ll-connect3.git
cd ll-connect3
./install.sh
```

After install:
- Run the app: `LConnect3`
- The kernel module auto‑loads on boot (`Lian_Li_SL_INFINITY`)
- Fan control is available at `/proc/Lian_li_SL_INFINITY/Port_X/fan_speed`

Optional GPU monitoring tools (install based on your GPU):

```bash
# NVIDIA
nvidia-smi   # included with NVIDIA proprietary drivers

# AMD
sudo apt install radeontop

# Intel
sudo apt install intel-gpu-tools
```

### Uninstall

```bash
cd ll-connect3
./uninstall.sh
```

The uninstall script removes the app, the kernel module, its auto‑load config, and build artifacts.

## Application Overview

- System Info, Fan Profiles, and Lighting control in one app.

- Per‑port custom fan curves with 4 presets and 3 custom slots.

- Built‑in RGB page with core effects, speed/brightness/direction.

## Development: Manual Build Instructions

If you prefer manual steps or are contributing, follow this section. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed contribution guidelines, and [kernel/INSTALL.md](kernel/INSTALL.md) for comprehensive kernel driver documentation.

### Prerequisites

- Linux kernel 5.4+
- Build tools and headers: `make`, `gcc`, `linux-headers` (your running kernel)
- Qt 6 (Core, Widgets), CMake 3.16+, `pkg-config`
- Libraries: `lm-sensors`, `libusb-1.0-0-dev`, `libhidapi-dev`

### Kernel Driver (Fan Only)

```bash
cd ll-connect3/kernel
make

# Install to system and refresh deps
make install    # copies .ko into /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/extra and runs depmod

# Load the module
sudo rmmod Lian_Li_SL_INFINITY 2>/dev/null || true
sudo modprobe Lian_Li_SL_INFINITY

# Auto‑load on boot
echo "Lian_Li_SL_INFINITY" | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/lian-li-sl-infinity.conf

# Verify
lsmod | grep Lian_Li
ls -R /proc/Lian_li_SL_INFINITY
```

Notes:
- Write 0–100 to `/proc/Lian_li_SL_INFINITY/Port_X/fan_speed` to set per‑port speed.
- Use the app for persistent fan presence configuration.

### Qt Application

```bash
cd ll-connect3
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install

# Run the app
LConnect3

# To uninstall the application
sudo make uninstall
```

### Testing

After building/installing manually, use these quick checks:

```bash
# Verify driver is loaded and proc entries exist
lsmod | grep Lian_Li
ls -R /proc/Lian_li_SL_INFINITY

# Per‑port fan speed test (0–100)
echo 100 | sudo tee /proc/Lian_li_SL_INFINITY/Port_1/fan_speed
echo  50 | sudo tee /proc/Lian_li_SL_INFINITY/Port_2/fan_speed

# Read back values
cat /proc/Lian_li_SL_INFINITY/Port_1/fan_speed
cat /proc/Lian_li_SL_INFINITY/Port_2/fan_speed

# Kernel logs (helpful for debugging)
sudo dmesg | grep -i "sli" | tail -20
```

Troubleshooting tips:
- Make sure kernel headers for your running kernel are installed.
- If you rebuilt the module, `sudo rmmod Lian_Li_SL_INFINITY && sudo modprobe Lian_Li_SL_INFINITY`.
- After distro kernel updates, rebuild: `make clean && make && make install` in `kernel/`.


## Troubleshooting (Basics)

```bash
# Detect device
lsusb | grep -i lian

# Kernel logs
sudo dmesg | grep -i "sli" | tail -20

# Missing headers (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
```
